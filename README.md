Hello,

First of all, it was a very enjoyable project. I had a lot of fun working on it.

As for the technical details:

I added an infinite scroll system that adjusts itself according to the screen size and can handle a limited number of infinite information.

The SetPass call should not exceed 12.

Due to time constraints and to shorten the tasks, I decided to use a third-party application for a*Pathfinding. However, I have some basic knowledge of how search algorithms work.

I pulled the object information displayed in the Product panel from the Resources file.

The GameBoard has a fixed area. Honestly, I'm not very satisfied with that part. However, the UI objects and logic adjust themselves to the screen resolution.

I think that's about it. If you have made the effort to read this far, thank you.

Until we meet again.

Best regards.
